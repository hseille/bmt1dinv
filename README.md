# BMT1Dinv: 1D Trans-dimensional MCMC inversion of magnetotelluric data considering model discrepancy

### Description:
BMT1Dinv is a software for analysing, inverting and vizualizing magnetotelluric (MT) data and probabilistic models.  
In consists in a C executable wrapped around several python scripts. The C executable performs the MCMC inversion, the python scripts calculates the 1D modelling assumption errors, create and reads the input/output files.
