abstract = {The MT interpretation procedure begins with a set of sounding data in the frequency domain. The overall quality of these data can be variable both as a function of frequency and location. Many simple interpretation procedures, such as the assessment of static distortion, act directly on the sounding data. A number of response characteristics, such as the location (in frequency) and number of turning points, are important to the interpretation. Localised scatter (noise) in the response estimates can produce false gradients which degrade the quality of the inferences made from the data. This study considers how the D+ solution can be used to process the raw sounding data to provide a number of interpretational advantages. Although the D+ solution has strict formal roots in 1D inverse theory, it is used here simply to enhance those data attributes, particularly that of physical validity, which lead to a more meaningful assessment of data characteristics. The data considered are 84 broadband array soundings from the Paran{\'{a}} basin, Brazil. The advantages provided by the D+ processed data set are demonstrated by using the raw and processed data in two main interpretational procedures. The first procedure concerns the ability of the data to provide quantitative assessments of the influence of static distortion. The second procedure concerns the application of transform methods which attempt to recover a resistivity/depth or reflectivity profile directly from the sounding data. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

@article{Xiang2018,
abstract = {This paper develops an efficient hierarchical trans-dimensional (trans-D) Bayesian algorithm to invert magnetotelluric (MT) data for subsurface geoelectrical structure, with unknown geophysical model parameterization (the number of conductivity-layer interfaces) and dataerror models parameterized by an auto-regressive (AR) process to account for potential error correlations. The reversible-jump Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm, which adds/removes interfaces and AR parameters in birth/death steps, is applied to sample the trans-D posterior probability density for model parameterization, model parameters, error variance and AR parameters, accounting for the uncertainties of model dimension and data-error statistics in the uncertainty estimates of the conductivity profile. To provide efficient sampling over the multiple subspaces of different dimensions, advanced proposal schemes are applied. Parameter perturbations are carried out in principal-component space, defined by eigen-decomposition of the unit-lag model covariance matrix, to minimize the effect of inter-parameter correlations and provide effective perturbation directions and length scales. Parameters of new layers in birth steps are proposed from the prior, instead of focused distributions centred at existing values, to improve birth acceptance rates. Parallel tempering, based on a series of parallel interacting Markov chains with successively relaxed likelihoods, is applied to improve chain mixing over model dimensions. The trans-D inversion is applied in a simulation study to examine the resolution of model structure according to the data information content. The inversion is also applied to a measured MT data set from south-central Australia.},

@article{Kelbert2020,
abstract = {Initial processing of magnetotelluric (MT) data collected at a site results in a small data file that defines the MT transfer functions (MT TFs) or variants at a discrete set of frequencies. Although not data intensive, the TF represents almost all of the information about earth's conductivity found in the raw data and provides a key input to geophysical inversion and to geomagnetic hazard-mitigation procedures. However, to be useful for scientific interpretation, MT TFs must be accompanied by carefully recorded metadata. The value of these data is amplified if they are collected into a common database in a discoverable fashion; to achieve this, the metadata must also be searchable. We have developed a new format for MT and related electromagnetic transfer function extensible markup language (EMTF XML), which is a novel, self-describing, searchable, and extensible way to store the data. We also evaluate our open-source, highly capable conversion tools that implement format conversion between historical MT TF formats (electrical data interchange [EDI], EDI SPECTRA, Z-files, and potentially others) and EMTF XML and we examine the associated issues of data rotation. We have paired our work with the open-source format conversion tools, EMTF FCU v4.0, with a user guide and a set of use case examples. We hope that this effort will assist the MT community in creating a more open data-sharing culture and practices.},

@misc{Rung-Arunwan2016,
abstract = {Through a large number of magnetotelluric (MT) observations conducted in a study area, one can obtain regional one-dimensional (1-D) features of the subsurface electrical conductivity structure simply by taking the geometric average of determinant invariants of observed impedances. This method was proposed by Berdichevsky and coworkers, which is based on the expectation that distortion effects due to near-surface electrical heterogeneities will be statistically smoothed out. A good estimation of a regional mean 1-model is useful, especially in recent years, to be used as a priori (or a starting) model in 3-inversion. However, the original theory was derived before the establishment of the present knowledge on galvanic distortion. This paper, therefore, reexamines the meaning of the Berdichevsky average by using the conventional formulation of galvanic distortion. A simple derivation shows that the determinant invariant of distorted impedance and its Berdichevsky average is always downward biased by the distortion parameters of shear and splitting. This means that the regional mean 1-model obtained from the Berdichevsky average tends to be more conductive. As an alternative rotational invariant, the sum of the squared elements (ssq) invariant is found to be less affected by bias from distortion parameters; thus, we conclude that its geometric average would be more suitable for estimating the regional structure. We find that the combination of determinant and ssq invariants provides parameters useful in dealing with a set of distorted MT impedances.},

@article{Seille2020a,
abstract = {Bayesian inversion of magnetotelluric (MT) data is a powerful but computationally expensive approach to estimate the subsurface electrical conductivity distribution and associated uncertainty. Approximating the Earth subsurface with 1-D physics considerably speeds-up calculation of the forward problem, making the Bayesian approach tractable, but can lead to biased results when the assumption is violated. We propose a methodology to quantitatively compensate for the bias caused by the 1-D Earth assumption within a 1-D trans-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler. Our approach determines site-specific likelihood functions which are calculated using a dimensionality discrepancy error model derived by a machine learning algorithm trained on a set of synthetic 3-D conductivity training images. This is achieved by exploiting known geometrical dimensional properties of the MT phase tensor. A complex synthetic model which mimics a sedimentary basin environment is used to illustrate the ability of our workflow to reliably estimate uncertainty in the inversion results, even in presence of strong 2-D and 3-D effects. Using this dimensionality discrepancy error model we demonstrate that on this synthetic data set the use of our workflow performs better in 80 per cent of the cases compared to the existing practice of using constant errors. Finally, our workflow is benchmarked against real data acquired in Queensland, Australia, and shows its ability to detect the depth to basement accurately.},
